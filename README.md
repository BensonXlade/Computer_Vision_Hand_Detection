Hand Detection Program

The Hand Detection Program leverages advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to perform real-time hand tracking and finger detection. Using OpenCV for video processing and MediaPipe for landmark tracking, this program visualises finger positions by dynamically drawing lines along detected landmarks.

Features:
	1,	Real-Time Processing: Captures live video feed and processes frames in real-time.
	2,	Hand Landmark Detection: Identifies unique hand landmarks using MediaPipe’s state-of-the-art hand tracking solution.
	3,	Dynamic Line Rendering: Visualises hand structure and movement by drawing lines along detected fingers and joints.

Workflow:
	1,	Video Input:
		Captures frames from a connected webcam using OpenCV’s video capture capabilities.
	2,	Preprocessing:
		Converts frames from BGR to RGB for compatibility with MediaPipe’s processing pipeline.
	3,	Hand Landmark Detection:
		Uses MediaPipe’s Hands solution to identify and map key hand landmarks.
	4,	Landmark Visualisation:
		Dynamically draws connections between detected landmarks to represent finger and joint structures.

Tools and Libraries:
	1,	OpenCV: For video capture and frame manipulation.
	2,	MediaPipe: For robust hand and finger landmark detection.

Repository Contents:
		Jupyter Notebook: The implementation code for the hand detection program, including frame capture, preprocessing, and landmark visualisation.
